				Connect Four
			</a></h2>
			<p>
				This assignment was to make a playable four in a row game using Node.js, Express, and React.  
				This assignment introduces us to React which is used to make the user interface in front end.  
				React makes it simple to create HTML pages using props which are like object in other class-based coding languages but just like Node.js and Express the syntax is hard to get used to.
			</p>

			<p>
				The biggest challenge in this assignment other than getting used to new syntax was trying to make the board display correctly when a user selects a square to play.  
				Since in a normal version of Four in a Row the pieces are dropped from above and stacks on top of each other.  
				The game board was an array of square props which had a background color value that would update accordingly to who turn it was.  
				Since the board is 6 x 7 it made the column of blocks end up being 7 indices away from each other in the array.  
				So, I ended up catching the array index of the square and storing it in a counter variable.  
				I would save that counter variable into an index variable if the counter variable were still within the array length, or it did not hit another block that was already taken.  
				Once the counter variable hits one of its two exit points, the array index variable would be to the correct square and square would then be updated to the correct color.
