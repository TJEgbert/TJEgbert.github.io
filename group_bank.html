				Group Banking App

			<p>
				Using the MERN stack, RESTful API, and sessions make a functioning bank app.  
				The app was split up between two assignments, the front end and the back end.  
				I coded the front end for the admin, created account and login page.  
				In the create account, since there were three roles a user could fall into customer, administrator, or employee.  
				I wanted to use radio buttons, but I wasn&#39;t sure to how to update the value, so I was able to pass it to the backend.  
				After some research I was able to figure out update a variable so I could pass it to the backend.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then for the second part of the assignment which was making the routes needed for the backend.  
				I worked on the routes related to the three pages mentioned above as will working on the session with another group member.  
				The was more just standard routes that we did in the previous assignments, so it wasn&#39;t too hard.  
				The new thing that was added for the assignment was to make it closer to a real-life scenario we ended up hashing the user 
				password and saving in the hash of it.  
				Luckly this wasn&#39;t too hard since JavaScript has a library that had the hashing we needed for the assignment.  
				It did take me a little bit of time to figure out exactly how to make it work but nothing too terrible.
