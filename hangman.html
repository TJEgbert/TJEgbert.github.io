				Hangman

			<p>
				This was the first group assignment we did for the CS3750.  
				Using the MERN stack, RESTful API, and sessions make a functioning Hangman game.  
				Having prior experience with game development my code section was the core game logic.  
				The most challenging part was getting the string back to the front end with letters guessed in the correct spot 
				while maintaining blank spaces.  
				Once the user gets a correct guess that letter would be saved into an array of letters in the word.  
				Then the word the user is guessing would get looped through checking if the letter was in correct guess array.  
				The return string would start being built if the letter were in the correct guess array it would then add that letter 
				to the return string.  Any other letter not in the correct guess array an underscore space would be added.
