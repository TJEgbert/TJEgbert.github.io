				Solo Banking App

			<p>
				This was a combination of two assignments where we used the whole MERN stack to handle a banking web application.  
				The first assignment was how to use Mongo and the RESTful API to handle the backend and communication with the frontend.  
				Then the next assignment was getting the front end working with the backend we did in the previous assignment. 
				 As well as adding Sessions to track when the user is logged in or out.
			</p>

			<p>
				For the first assignment with the focus on backend mainly getting the routes working and getting the Mongo database set up.  
				Mongo being documented-oriented database made it easy to save JSON object into a database.  
				Getting the database set up in code was relatively easy since MongoDB already had most of the code needed to make work in the 
				project.  
				You just must switch a couple of things, and it was good to go.  
				One of challenges was getting used to how to make queries to the database in the routes.  
				Having the semester prior I had taken the advance database class we worked with MongoDB a little bit, 
				so I was familiar with how to make the queries.  
				But since it&#39;s in code it works differently so it took a little bit to get used to that and start getting the data back I wanted.  
				The other challenge was getting the information from the routes to save into the database.  
				This is where RESTful API comes into play and again it comes down to syntax.  
				Learning how RESTful wanted the data in the first place and how it wanted to return the data.  
				This just took a little bit of practice to remember syntax but after a couple of routes I had it down.
			</p>

			<p>
				For the next assignment it was putting everything together in the MERN stack and adding sessions into it.  
				MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js while sessions is a way to track a user throughout a website.  
				Sessions are more commonly known as cookies.  
				This wasn&#39;t too bad since the backend was done other than sessions it was easy to make the front end and get the information 
				sent to the backend.  
				Like I mentioned for the first assignment it took a little to figure out how exactly the RESTful API wanted the information
				 sent to is so that took a me a little bit of time to figure out.  
				 The other was figuring out once the session was set was how to include that into a request to the backend 
				 so the backend could use that to get the user information from the database.  
				 Many of hours debugging and doing research to figure out all I need to do in the POST or GET was add “include credentials” 
				 and then it was included in the request in a easily accessible req.session.username.
