										<h2>Why I made it</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										I like most gamer adults have a huge back log of games stretching between many different platforms and some are bound to get forgotten.  
										That was the main idea going into making a program where I could enter my game collection and have it easily searchable and updates 
										as I put more games into it.  That was until I asked my brother for his opinion since we are in the same boat.
										  This was when the idea of using an API came from to help fill out some of the information about the game for you.  
										  Just from adding in the API this went from a week project into almost two.  Also, I need more projects for my portfolio.
										  You can go straight to the repository by <a href="https://github.com/TJEgbert/GameDatabase">clicking here.</a>

												<h3>Client Info Screen </h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												This window allows the user to enter in the Client ID and Client Info you get from Twitch in the database.  
												This allows the user to be able to connect to the IGDB API later in the Add Game Window.  
												This was the first hurdle of the project was getting the access token needed to be able to connect to IGDB API.  
												With the Client ID and Secret you need to make a Post to Twitch so they can send back the access token and the expiration date.  
												To achieve this, I ended up using RestEase to make the interface and Post with the information to Twitch.  
												From there I used NewtonSoft.Json to then deserialized the returning .Json.  
												This was one of the first big hurdles of the program was getting this all to work here and the Add Game Window.  
												With no prior knowledge I jumped into the RestEase documentation to figure it out.  
												After reading it all I jumped into the API documentation to see what they were expected to receive.  
												They expected Post with the particle path with ClientID and Secret.  
												This was simple enough to do with RestEase make a simple Post with the path once I knew what I was doing.  
												From there it all went to the Microsoft Access files to store for whenever the program needed it use it later.

												<h3>Main window</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												This was the window that gave me the least trouble out of all of them.  
												It&#x27;s also the window that I had put the most thought into before I started to code since nothing huge was added on to it later.  
												All this window is doing is acting as an interface with database.  
												It displays everything the database has in the Game table, and the search filters are generated from the database itself.  
												My favorite moment when I was coding this window was making it so the user could update the records right from there.  
												I saw you could enable editing on data grid, so I had it do that, but I needed to tell if something was edited.  
												This was where the observable collection worked so well.  
												I ended up having a bool on the game object that would be checked true if it was edited on the data grid.  
												Once the user clicks save it removes the entry and puts it back into the database with the updated information.  
												The thing that shocked me the most was it worked on the first try.
